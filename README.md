This is the repository for the seamlesssim package, which accompanies Boonstra, Braun, and Chase's paper on seamless trial design (Arxiv 2020). Interested users should examine that paper, along with the manual and vignette posted here, for examples and explanations for how to use the package. 

The package can be installed by running the command `devtools::install_github("elizabethchase/seamlesssim")`.
